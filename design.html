    <h2>List the pros and cons of microservices</h2>
    <h2>How to determine what Context Boundaries</h2>
    <h2>What is a distributed system</h2>
    <h2>Discuss the two ways to scale a system</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Horizontal - Adding more features to a single server</li>
        <li>Vertical - Adding more servers</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Talk about deployment strategies</h2>

    <dl>
        <dt><b>Rolling Deployments</b>: Updates are gradually rolled out to a small subset of servers at a time. 
            Once a batch is verified to be stable, the next batch is updated, and so on, until the entire fleet is on the new version.</dt>

        <dt><b>Canary Deployments</b> - A small percentage of users (canary group) are directed to the new version first.  
            Performance and user feedback are closely monitored for the canary group before rolling out the update to a larger user base.</dt>
        <dd>- white cold drink</dd>
        <dt><b>Blue-Green Deployments:</b> Maintains two identical production environments (Blue and Green). The update is deployed to the Green environment first. 
            Once thoroughly tested and validated, traffic is switched over from Blue to Green, effectively making the new version live.</dt>
